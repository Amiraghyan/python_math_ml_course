\begin{problem}
Khachik thinks of a whole number (integer) and asks Vachik to keep another whole number in his mind. If Vachik's number is greater than that of Khachik, Vachik wins, otherwise Khachik wins. We know that if Khachik loses, he will ask for another round and they will play one more time. What is the probability that after all, Khachik would win at least once?
