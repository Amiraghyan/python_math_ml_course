\begin{problem}[1 point]
You ask your neighbor to water your flowers while you are on vacation. If the flowers are watered, they have about $0.85$ chance of survival; otherwise, they will only survive with probability $0.2$. You are $90$ percent sure your neighbor will water the flowers, but when you are back, you see the flowers are wilted (didn't survive). What is the probability your neighbor didn't water the flowers? Should you trust her anymore?

\begin{problem}[1 point]
    Rosie has ten coins. Nine of them are ordinary coins with equal chances of coming up Head and Tail when tossed, and the tenth has two Heads.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[a) ] If she takes one of the coins at random from her pocket, what is the probability that it is the coin
with two Heads?

        \item[b) ] If she tosses the coin and it comes up Heads, what is the probability that it is the coin with two Heads?

        \item[c) ] If she tosses the coin one further time and it comes up Tails, what is the probability that it is one of
the nine ordinary coins?

\begin{problem}[1 point]
    The world famous gambler Vardanik (from Parakar) proposes the following game of chance. You roll a fair die. If you roll a 1, then Vardanik pays you \$25. If you roll a 2, 
Vardanik pays you \$5. If you roll a 3, you win nothing. If you roll a 4 or a 5, you must 
pay Vardanik \$10, and if you roll a 6, you must pay Vardanik \$15. Do you want to play?

\begin{problem}[1 point]
    You draw one card from a 52-card deck of playing cards. If you pick a heart, you will win 
\$10. If you pick a face card (i.e. Jack, Queen or King), which is not a heart, you win \$8. If you pick any other card, 
you lose \$6. Do you want to play? Approximately how much would you win or lose after playing 1,000,000 times?
