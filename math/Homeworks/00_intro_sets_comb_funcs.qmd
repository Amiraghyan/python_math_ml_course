# Sets

## 01 Two-annotator inclusion‚Äìexclusion {data-difficulty="1"}
Out of 1,000 images, annotator $A$ flags 260 as "elephant," annotator $B$ flags 310 as "elephant," and both flag 190.

1. How many images at least one annotator called "elephant"?
2. How many images neither annotator called "elephant"?

## 02 Train/Test leakage {data-difficulty="2"}

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Context
When creating Machine Learning (ML) models, we split the data into 2 parts - one for training the model and one for testing how good it is (well, we actually usually split to 3 parts - train, validation, test, but for this problem we'll go with the half-truth)
:::

You collected **200** images. Train set $T$ has 140 indices; Test set $S$ has 40. We noticed an overlap $|T\cap S|=4$.

1. Are the splits disjoint? If not, how many **unique** images actually exist across both sets?
2. How many items must be **moved** to make $T$ and $S$ **disjoint** with target sizes $140$ and $40$ (no duplicates)? Propose a minimal-move strategy.

## 03 Divisibility via inclusion‚Äìexclusion {data-difficulty="2"}
How many integers in ${1,\dots,100}$ are divisible by $5$ **or** $7$.

## 04 Inclusion-exclusion principle for 3 sets {data-difficulty="3"}
Figure out the equation of the inclusion-exclusion principle for 3 sets. You may find it useful to draw a Venn diagram.

# Combinatorics

## 05 Augmentation pipeline counting {data-difficulty="1"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Context
Sometimes we have the need of expanding our dataset size, but we can't acquire more data. For such cases we use a technique called **data augmentation** to artificially expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset - like rotating them, flipping and so on.
:::

An image pipeline does: random crop (3 sizes), color jitter (on/off), horizontal flip (on/off), and chooses one of 4 background textures.

Assuming independence, how many distinct augmentation "recipes" can be produced for a given image? Example recipe is (crop: 2nd size, flip: 1 (on), texture: 3rd type).

## 06 Two hyperparameters ‚Äî combinations {data-difficulty="1"}

::: {.callout-important collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Context
In ML, we often need to prespecify some parameters (we call them hyperparameters) beforehand - for example we need to choose which optimization algorithm to chose.
:::

Let hyperparameter set $H_1$ have $m$ options and $H_2$ have $n$ options.

If we want to try the whole grid of options how many combinations do we have?

## 07 Armenian car plates {data-difficulty="2"}
Armenian cars have the format `DD LL DDD`, digits 0‚Äì9, letters A‚ÄìZ, repetition allowed.

1. How many distinct plates exist?
2. How does the answer change if letters cannot repeat inside the same plate?

## 08 Anagrams of "cheese" {data-difficulty="2"}
How many distinct words can you form by rearranging the letters of "cheese"? (Handle repeated letters carefully.)

# Functions

## 09 Real-world examples {data-difficulty="1"}
Give one **real-life** example (and short justification) for 1. injective 2. surjective and 3. bijective mapping.

## 10 Counting small functions {data-difficulty="2"}
How many functions $f:\{1,2,3\}\to\{a,b\}$?

How many are **injective**? How many are **surjective**? *(Hint: total is $2^3$.)*

## 11 Even/odd ‚Äî activation symmetry {data-difficulty="2"}
Classify each as **even**, **odd**, or **neither**, and briefly note the symmetry implication:

- $f(x)=x^2$ 
- $g(x)=x^3$
- $s(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ (this function is called `sigmoid` and we'll encounter it a lot in ML) 
- $p(x)=\max(0,x)$ (same as above, but the name is `REctified Linear Unit`)

## 12 Function properties {data-difficulty="2"}
Given $f(x)=x+3x^2$, determine:

- Is it injective or not?
- Is it surjective or not?
- Is it bijective or not?
- What is the image of $A$ under $f$, when $A=[-1,2]$?
- What is the preimage of $B$ under $f$, when $B=[0,5]$?
  
## 13 Both even and odd {data-difficulty="3"}
Describe **all** functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ that are simultaneously even and odd. 

## 14 Inclusion‚Äìexclusion for surjections {.bonus-problem data-difficulty="3"}
Count **surjective** functions $f:\{1,2,3,4\}\to\{a,b,c\}$ using inclusion‚Äìexclusion. Show your work.
