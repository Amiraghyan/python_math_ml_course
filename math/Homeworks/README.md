# Homework System Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Homework Structure Guide
- **File**: `homework_structure_guide.md`
- **Purpose**: Documentation for creating standardized homework files
- **Features**: Templates for YAML headers, problem structure, solution sections

### 2. Cheese Emoji Difficulty System 
- **File**: `homework-scripts.js`
- **Purpose**: Visual difficulty indicators for homework problems
- **Features**: 
  - 🧀 (1 cheese) = Easy problems
  - 🧀🧀 (2 cheese) = Medium problems  
  - 🧀🧀🧀 (3 cheese) = Hard problems
- **Usage**: Add `data-difficulty="1"`, `data-difficulty="2"`, or `data-difficulty="3"` to problem headers

### 3. Standardized File Structure
- **Current Files**: `00_intro_sets_comb_funcs.qmd`
- **Features**:
  - Clean YAML headers
  - External JavaScript inclusion
  - Tabbed sections with `panel-tabset`
  - Collapsible solutions with `content-visible when-profile="solution"`
  - Proper problem numbering and difficulty indicators

### 4. Main Configuration Integration
- **File**: `_quarto.yml`
- **Updated**: Math section includes homework files
- **Benefit**: Homework files are now part of the main Quarto book

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Students:
1. Look for cheese emojis to see problem difficulty
2. Solutions are hidden by default
3. Use tabbed sections to navigate between topics

### For Instructors:
1. Follow the homework structure guide when creating new files
2. Add `data-difficulty` attributes to problem headers
3. Use `content-visible when-profile="solution"` for solutions
4. Render with `quarto render --profile solution` to show answers

### For Developers:
1. JavaScript automatically adds cheese emojis based on `data-difficulty` attributes
2. No alignment features (removed for simplicity)
3. External JS file approach for maintainability
