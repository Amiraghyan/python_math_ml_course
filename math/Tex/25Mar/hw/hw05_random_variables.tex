\begin{problem}
        A spam filter tags emails as spam or not spam. Based on historical data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $80\%$ of spam emails contain the word "lottery."
        \item $30\%$ of non-spam emails contain the word "lottery."
        \item $40\%$ of emails are spam.
    \end{itemize}
    
    What is the probability that an email  containing the word "lottery" is spam?

\begin{problem}
Two factories produce similar weapons and deliver it to the army warehouse. The first factoryâ€™s productivity is two times more than that of
the second one. Moreover, $40\%$ of the weapons produced by the first
factory have some defects, while the same indicator is only $16\%$ for
the second factory. We randomly take a weapon from the warehouse,
test it and it appears to have no defects. What is the probability that
the weapon was produced by the first factory?

You ask your neighbor to water your flowers while you are on vacation. If the flowers are watered, they have about $0.85$ chance of survival; otherwise, they will only survive with probability $0.2$. You are $90$ percent sure your neighbor will water the flowers, but when you are back, you see the flowers didn't survive. What is the probability your neighbor didn't water the flowers? Should you trust her anymore?

\begin{problem}
Anush and Nairi are shopping at the mall. They agree to split up for a time and then meet for lunch. They plan to meet in
front of Kinopark between 12:00 and 13:00. The one who arrives first agrees to wait $15$ minutes for the other to arrive. After $15$
minutes, that person will leave and continue shopping. What is the probability that they will meet if each one of them arrives at any time between 12:00 and 13:00?

\textit{Hint: Try to represent the problem on the coordinate system, by letting
$x$ denote the time Anush arrives, and $y$, the time Nairi arrives.}

    The world famous gambler Vardanik from Parakar proposes the following game of chance. You roll a fair die. If you roll $1$,  Vardanik pays you $\$25$. If you roll  $2$, 
Vardanik pays you \$$5$. If you roll $3$, you win nothing. If you roll $4$ or $5$, you must 
pay Vardanik \$$10$, and if you roll $6$, you must pay Vardanik \$15. Do you want to play?
