You have $12$ square meters of cardboard (as well as scissors, and glue) and this time you want to make a topless box (i.e. no upper side) like this:
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{figs/topless-box.png}

\end{center}
What is the maximum volume your box can have?



\smallskip 

{\small \textit{Hint:  This time we have no squares, so you can denote its height, length and width by $x$, $y$ and $z$. Can you express $z$ by $x$ and $y$? Can you then express the volume by $x$ and $y$? How do we find the maximum value of a function of two variables?}

\begin{problem}[\textbf{additional}]
There are a couple of ways to make one new function from two given functions. One of them is \textit{convolution} which is an  important technique in ML.

For any two functions $f$ and $g$,  their convolution is a new function $f*g$, which is defined by the formula:
\[
(f*g)(x) = \int_{-1}^1 f(y)g(x-y) \, dy \qquad \text{(where $x$ is fixed)}
\]
Given $f(x)=x^2$ and \[g(x) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } x>0\\
    0 & \text{if } x \le 0
\end{cases}\]
find the value of $f*g$ at the point $x=0$.


\smallskip 

{\small \textit{Hint:  Plug in the formula for $g$, then divide $[-1,1]$ into two parts where $g=0$ and where $g=1$.}
