## Problem 1: Spam Filter - Bayes' Theorem

A spam filter tags emails as spam or not spam. Based on historical data:

- 80% of spam emails contain the word "lottery"
- 30% of non-spam emails contain the word "lottery"  
- 40% of emails are spam

What is the probability that an email containing the word "lottery" is spam?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Given information:**

- $P(\text{lottery}|\text{spam}) = 0.8$
- $P(\text{lottery}|\text{not spam}) = 0.3$
- $P(\text{spam}) = 0.4$, so $P(\text{not spam}) = 0.6$

**Find:** $P(\text{spam}|\text{lottery})$

**Step 1: Use Bayes' Theorem**
$$P(\text{spam}|\text{lottery}) = \frac{P(\text{lottery}|\text{spam}) \cdot P(\text{spam})}{P(\text{lottery})}$$

**Step 2: Find $P(\text{lottery})$ using the law of total probability**
$$P(\text{lottery}) = P(\text{lottery}|\text{spam}) \cdot P(\text{spam}) + P(\text{lottery}|\text{not spam}) \cdot P(\text{not spam})$$
$$= 0.8 \times 0.4 + 0.3 \times 0.6 = 0.32 + 0.18 = 0.5$$

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' formula**
$$P(\text{spam}|\text{lottery}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.4}{0.5} = \frac{0.32}{0.5} = 0.64$$

**Answer:** The probability that an email containing "lottery" is spam is **64%**.

## Problem 2: Colored Pencils from Two Boxes

There are two boxes containing $\{5, 11, 8\}$ and $\{10, 8, 6\}$ white, black, red pencils respectively. One pencil is drawn from each box. What is the probability that the pencils have the same color?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Box 1:** 5 white, 11 black, 8 red (total: 24)

**Box 2:** 10 white, 8 black, 6 red (total: 24)

**Method:** Calculate probability for each matching color and sum them.

**Same color outcomes:**

**Both white:**
$$P(\text{both white}) = \frac{5}{24} \times \frac{10}{24} = \frac{50}{576}$$

**Both black:**
$$P(\text{both black}) = \frac{11}{24} \times \frac{8}{24} = \frac{88}{576}$$

**Both red:**
$$P(\text{both red}) = \frac{8}{24} \times \frac{6}{24} = \frac{48}{576}$$

**Total probability of same color:**
$$P(\text{same color}) = \frac{50 + 88 + 48}{576} = \frac{186}{576} = \frac{31}{96}$$

**Simplification check:**
$$\frac{186}{576} = \frac{31 \times 6}{96 \times 6} = \frac{31}{96}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{31}{96} \approx 0.323$ or about 32.3%

## Problem 3: Babies and Mothers

Three babies are given a weekly health check at a clinic, and then returned randomly to their mothers. What is the probability that at least one baby goes to the right mother?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

We want 1 - P(no baby goes to right mother).

**Method 1: Direct counting**

**Total arrangements:** $3! = 6$

**Arrangements where no baby goes to correct mother (derangements):**

- Baby 1 ‚Üí Mother 2, Baby 2 ‚Üí Mother 3, Baby 3 ‚Üí Mother 1
- Baby 1 ‚Üí Mother 3, Baby 2 ‚Üí Mother 1, Baby 3 ‚Üí Mother 2

**Number of derangements:** 2

**Probability of at least one correct match:**
$$P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - \frac{2}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$$

**Method 2: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

Let $A_i$ = event that baby $i$ goes to correct mother.

$$P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3) = \sum P(A_i) - \sum P(A_i \cap A_j) + P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)$$

- $P(A_i) = \frac{1}{3}$ for each $i$
- $P(A_i \cap A_j) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$ for $i \neq j$
- $P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{6}$

$$P(\text{at least one correct}) = 3 \times \frac{1}{3} - 3 \times \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667$ or about 66.7%
:::

## Problem 4: Factory Weapons Quality

Two factories produce weapons. Factory 1's productivity is twice that of Factory 2. 40% of Factory 1's weapons have defects, while 16% of Factory 2's weapons have defects. A randomly selected weapon has no defects. What is the probability it was produced by Factory 1?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Given information:**

- Factory 1 produces twice as much as Factory 2
- So: $P(\text{Factory 1}) = \frac{2}{3}$, $P(\text{Factory 2}) = \frac{1}{3}$
- $P(\text{defect}|\text{Factory 1}) = 0.4$, so $P(\text{no defect}|\text{Factory 1}) = 0.6$
- $P(\text{defect}|\text{Factory 2}) = 0.16$, so $P(\text{no defect}|\text{Factory 2}) = 0.84$

**Find:** $P(\text{Factory 1}|\text{no defect})$

**Step 1: Find $P(\text{no defect})$ using law of total probability**
$$P(\text{no defect}) = P(\text{no defect}|\text{Factory 1}) \cdot P(\text{Factory 1}) + P(\text{no defect}|\text{Factory 2}) \cdot P(\text{Factory 2})$$
$$= 0.6 \times \frac{2}{3} + 0.84 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1.2}{3} + \frac{0.84}{3} = \frac{2.04}{3} = 0.68$$

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem**
$$P(\text{Factory 1}|\text{no defect}) = \frac{P(\text{no defect}|\text{Factory 1}) \cdot P(\text{Factory 1})}{P(\text{no defect})}$$
$$= \frac{0.6 \times \frac{2}{3}}{0.68} = \frac{0.4}{0.68} = \frac{10}{17}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{10}{17} \approx 0.588$ or about 58.8%

**Interpretation:** Even though Factory 1 has a higher defect rate, its much higher production volume means that most non-defective weapons still come from Factory 1.

## Problem 5: Flower Watering

You ask your neighbor to water your flowers while on vacation. If watered, flowers have 0.85 survival probability; if not watered, only 0.2 survival probability. You're 90% sure your neighbor will water them, but the flowers didn't survive. What's the probability your neighbor didn't water them? Should you trust her anymore?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Given:**

- $P(\text{watered}) = 0.9$, $P(\text{not watered}) = 0.1$
- $P(\text{survive}|\text{watered}) = 0.85$, $P(\text{die}|\text{watered}) = 0.15$
- $P(\text{survive}|\text{not watered}) = 0.2$, $P(\text{die}|\text{not watered}) = 0.8$

**Find:** $P(\text{not watered}|\text{flowers died})$

**Step 1: Find $P(\text{flowers died})$**
$$P(\text{die}) = P(\text{die}|\text{watered}) \cdot P(\text{watered}) + P(\text{die}|\text{not watered}) \cdot P(\text{not watered})$$
$$= 0.15 \times 0.9 + 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.135 + 0.08 = 0.215$$

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem**
$$P(\text{not watered}|\text{died}) = \frac{P(\text{died}|\text{not watered}) \cdot P(\text{not watered})}{P(\text{died})}$$
$$= \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.215} = \frac{0.08}{0.215} \approx 0.372$$

**Answer:** The probability that your neighbor didn't water the flowers is about **37.2%**.

**Should you trust her?** This is a judgment call, but consider:

- There's still a 62.8% chance she did water them and they died anyway
- Even with watering, there's a 15% chance of death
- The evidence against her isn't overwhelming

## Problem 6: Transportation and Lateness

Nune uses her car 30% of the time, walks 30% of the time, and rides the bus 40% of the time. She's late 3% when driving, 10% when walking, and 7% when taking the bus.

a) Yesterday she was late. What's the probability she took the bus?
b) Today she was on time. Do you think she walked?


::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solutions {.solution-header}

**Given:**

- $P(\text{car}) = 0.3$, $P(\text{walk}) = 0.3$, $P(\text{bus}) = 0.4$
- $P(\text{late}|\text{car}) = 0.03$, $P(\text{late}|\text{walk}) = 0.10$, $P(\text{late}|\text{bus}) = 0.07$

**Part a) Yesterday she was late. Probability she took the bus?**

**Step 1: Find $P(\text{late})$**
$$P(\text{late}) = \sum P(\text{late}|\text{mode}) \cdot P(\text{mode})$$
$$= 0.03 \times 0.3 + 0.10 \times 0.3 + 0.07 \times 0.4$$
$$= 0.009 + 0.030 + 0.028 = 0.067$$

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem**
$$P(\text{bus}|\text{late}) = \frac{P(\text{late}|\text{bus}) \cdot P(\text{bus})}{P(\text{late})} = \frac{0.07 \times 0.4}{0.067} = \frac{0.028}{0.067} \approx 0.418$$

**Part b) Today she was on time. Probability she walked?**

**Step 1: Find $P(\text{on time})$**
$$P(\text{on time}) = 1 - P(\text{late}) = 1 - 0.067 = 0.933$$

Alternatively:
$$P(\text{on time}) = 0.97 \times 0.3 + 0.90 \times 0.3 + 0.93 \times 0.4 = 0.933$$

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem**
$$P(\text{walk}|\text{on time}) = \frac{P(\text{on time}|\text{walk}) \cdot P(\text{walk})}{P(\text{on time})}$$
$$= \frac{0.90 \times 0.3}{0.933} = \frac{0.27}{0.933} \approx 0.289$$

**Answers:**

- **a)** Probability she took the bus: **41.8%**
- **b)** Probability she walked: **28.9%**

**Interpretation for b):** The probability she walked (28.9%) is slightly less than her baseline walking probability (30%), because walking has the highest lateness rate, so being on time provides weak evidence against walking.

## Problem 7: Rosie's Coins

Rosie has ten coins: nine ordinary (fair) coins and one with two heads. 

a) Random coin selection probability
b) If she tosses a coin and gets heads, what's the probability it's the two-headed coin?
c) If she tosses it again and gets tails, what's the probability it's an ordinary coin?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solutions {.solution-header}

**Setup:**

- 9 ordinary coins: $P(\text{heads}) = P(\text{tails}) = 0.5$
- 1 two-headed coin: $P(\text{heads}) = 1$, $P(\text{tails}) = 0$

**Part a) Probability of selecting the two-headed coin**
$$P(\text{two-headed}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$

**Part b) She tosses and gets heads. Probability it's two-headed?**

**Step 1: Find $P(\text{heads})$**
$$P(\text{heads}) = P(\text{heads}|\text{ordinary}) \cdot P(\text{ordinary}) + P(\text{heads}|\text{two-headed}) \cdot P(\text{two-headed})$$
$$= 0.5 \times 0.9 + 1.0 \times 0.1 = 0.45 + 0.1 = 0.55$$

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem**
$$P(\text{two-headed}|\text{heads}) = \frac{P(\text{heads}|\text{two-headed}) \cdot P(\text{two-headed})}{P(\text{heads})}$$
$$= \frac{1.0 \times 0.1}{0.55} = \frac{0.1}{0.55} = \frac{2}{11} \approx 0.182$$

**Part c) She tosses again and gets tails. Probability it's ordinary?**

**Key insight:** The two-headed coin cannot produce tails! So if we observe tails, the coin must be ordinary.

$$P(\text{ordinary}|\text{tails}) = 1$$

**Alternative verification using Bayes:**
$$P(\text{tails}) = P(\text{tails}|\text{ordinary}) \cdot P(\text{ordinary}) + P(\text{tails}|\text{two-headed}) \cdot P(\text{two-headed})$$
$$= 0.5 \times 0.9 + 0 \times 0.1 = 0.45$$

$$P(\text{ordinary}|\text{tails}) = \frac{P(\text{tails}|\text{ordinary}) \cdot P(\text{ordinary})}{P(\text{tails})} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.9}{0.45} = 1$$

**Answers:**

- **a)** $\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$ or 10%
- **b)** $\frac{2}{11} \approx 0.182$ or about 18.2%  
- **c)** $1$ or 100%

**Intuition:** Getting heads increases the probability it's the special coin (from 10% to 18.2%), but getting tails definitively proves it's ordinary.

## Problem 8: Photography Shop Disaster (Additional)

After a trip to Garni-Geghard, you bring film with 24 photos to a shop. They ruin 4 consecutive photos. What's the probability the ruined photos included:

a) the 8th or 9th or 10th photos
b) the 8th and 9th and 10th photos

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solutions {.solution-header}

**Setup:** 4 consecutive photos are ruined out of 24 total photos. We need to find where this block of 4 can start.

**Possible starting positions:** The block of 4 can start at positions 1, 2, 3, ..., 21 (since starting at position 22 would extend beyond photo 24).

**Total possible outcomes:** 21 equally likely positions for the ruined block.

**Part a) Probability that ruined photos include 8th OR 9th OR 10th**

**Method:** Find positions where the block includes at least one of photos 8, 9, or 10.

**Block includes photo 8:** Block starts at positions 5, 6, 7, or 8

- Starting at 5: ruins photos 5,6,7,8
- Starting at 6: ruins photos 6,7,8,9  
- Starting at 7: ruins photos 7,8,9,10
- Starting at 8: ruins photos 8,9,10,11

**Block includes photo 9:** Block starts at positions 6, 7, 8, or 9
**Block includes photo 10:** Block starts at positions 7, 8, 9, or 10

**Union:** Starting positions that include at least one of {8,9,10}: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

**Count:** 6 favorable positions out of 21 total

$$P(\text{includes 8 or 9 or 10}) = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7}$$

**Part b) Probability that ruined photos include 8th AND 9th AND 10th**

For the block to include all three photos 8, 9, and 10, it must start at position 7 or 8:

- Starting at 7: ruins photos 7,8,9,10 ‚úì
- Starting at 8: ruins photos 8,9,10,11 ‚úì

**Count:** 2 favorable positions out of 21 total

$$P(\text{includes 8 and 9 and 10}) = \frac{2}{21}$$

**Answers:**

- **a)** $\frac{2}{7} \approx 0.286$ or about 28.6%
- **b)** $\frac{2}{21} \approx 0.095$ or about 9.5%

## Problem 10: Modified Die

Vahe modified a standard die:

- Added one dot to the ‚öÉ side, making it ‚öÑ  
- Added two dots to the ‚öÄ side, making it ‚öÇ

Find the probability that the outcome is greater than 4, and calculate the expectation and variance.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Modified die faces:**

- Original ‚öÄ (1) + 2 dots = ‚öÇ (3)
- ‚öÅ (2) remains ‚öÅ (2)  
- ‚öÇ (3) remains ‚öÇ (3)
- Original ‚öÉ (4) + 1 dot = ‚öÑ (5)
- ‚öÑ (5) remains ‚öÑ (5)
- ‚öÖ (6) remains ‚öÖ (6)

**Outcome distribution:** [3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6]

**Step 1: Find probability distribution**

- Value 2: appears 1 time, $P(X = 2) = \frac{1}{6}$
- Value 3: appears 2 times, $P(X = 3) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
- Value 5: appears 2 times, $P(X = 5) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
- Value 6: appears 1 time, $P(X = 6) = \frac{1}{6}$

**Step 2: Probability that outcome > 4**
Values greater than 4: {5, 6}
$$P(X > 4) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Step 3: Calculate expectation**
$$E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X = x) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{2}{6} + 5 \cdot \frac{2}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6}$$
$$= \frac{2 + 6 + 10 + 6}{6} = \frac{24}{6} = 4$$

**Step 4: Calculate variance**
First find $E[X^2]$:
$$E[X^2] = 2^2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 3^2 \cdot \frac{2}{6} + 5^2 \cdot \frac{2}{6} + 6^2 \cdot \frac{1}{6}$$
$$= \frac{4 + 18 + 50 + 36}{6} = \frac{108}{6} = 18$$

$$\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = 18 - 4^2 = 18 - 16 = 2$$

**Answers:**

- **Probability of outcome > 4:** $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$
- **Expectation:** $E[X] = 4$
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = 2$

**Comparison with standard die:**

- Standard die: $E[X] = 3.5$, $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{35}{12} \approx 2.92$
- Modified die: $E[X] = 4$, $\text{Var}(X) = 2$

The modifications increased the expected value while decreasing the variance.

## Problem 11: Vardanik's Game

Vardanik proposes a game with a fair die:

- Roll 1: win $25
- Roll 2: win $5  
- Roll 3: win $0
- Roll 4 or 5: lose $10
- Roll 6: lose $15

Should you play this game?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Calculate the expected value** to determine if the game is favorable.

**Step 1: List outcomes and their probabilities**

- $P(\text{roll 1}) = \frac{1}{6}$, winnings = $+25$
- $P(\text{roll 2}) = \frac{1}{6}$, winnings = $+5$
- $P(\text{roll 3}) = \frac{1}{6}$, winnings = $0$
- $P(\text{roll 4 or 5}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$, winnings = $-10$
- $P(\text{roll 6}) = \frac{1}{6}$, winnings = $-15$

**Step 2: Calculate expected value**
$$E[\text{winnings}] = 25 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + (-10) \cdot \frac{2}{6} + (-15) \cdot \frac{1}{6}$$

$$= \frac{25 + 5 + 0 - 20 - 15}{6} = \frac{-5}{6} \approx -0.833$$

**Step 3: Interpretation**
The expected value is $-\frac{5}{6} \approx -\$0.83$ per game.

**Answer:** **NO, you should not play this game.**

**Reasoning:**

- On average, you lose about 83 cents per game
- The game is unfavorable to the player
- Over many games, you would expect to lose money

**Risk analysis:**

- **Best case:** Win $25 (probability $\frac{1}{6} \approx 16.7\%$)
- **Worst case:** Lose $15 (probability $\frac{1}{6} \approx 16.7\%$)
- **Most likely bad outcome:** Lose $10 (probability $\frac{1}{3} \approx 33.3\%$)

The relatively high probability of losing combined with the negative expected value makes this an unfavorable game for the player.

## Problem 12: Continuous Random Variable with PDF

Let $X$ be a random variable with PDF:
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x, & 0 \le x \le 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Find the expectation and variance of:
a) $X$
b) $2X$  
c) $2X + 7$


::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solutions {.solution-header}

**Given:** $f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x, & 0 \le x \le 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

**Part a) For $X$:**

**Step 1: Calculate $E[X]$**
$$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 x \cdot 2x \, dx = \int_0^1 2x^2 \, dx$$
$$= 2 \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$$

**Step 2: Calculate $E[X^2]$**
$$E[X^2] = \int_0^1 x^2 \cdot 2x \, dx = \int_0^1 2x^3 \, dx = 2 \left[\frac{x^4}{4}\right]_0^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Step 3: Calculate $\text{Var}(X)$**
$$\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{9-8}{18} = \frac{1}{18}$$

**Part b) For $2X$:**

Using the properties: $E[aX] = a \cdot E[X]$ and $\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \cdot \text{Var}(X)$

$$E[2X] = 2 \cdot E[X] = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$$

$$\text{Var}(2X) = 2^2 \cdot \text{Var}(X) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{18} = \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9}$$

**Part c) For $2X + 7$:**

Using the properties: $E[aX + b] = a \cdot E[X] + b$ and $\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \cdot \text{Var}(X)$

$$E[2X + 7] = 2 \cdot E[X] + 7 = \frac{4}{3} + 7 = \frac{4 + 21}{3} = \frac{25}{3}$$

$$\text{Var}(2X + 7) = \text{Var}(2X) = \frac{2}{9}$$

*Note: Adding a constant doesn't change the variance.*

**Summary:**

- **a)** $E[X] = \frac{2}{3}$, $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{18}$
- **b)** $E[2X] = \frac{4}{3}$, $\text{Var}(2X) = \frac{2}{9}$
- **c)** $E[2X + 7] = \frac{25}{3}$, $\text{Var}(2X + 7) = \frac{2}{9}$

## Problem 13: Sum of Uniform Random Variables (Additional)

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two continuous random variables with uniform distribution on $(0,2)$. Find the expectation of $X+Y$.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Given:** $X \sim \text{Uniform}(0,2)$ and $Y \sim \text{Uniform}(0,2)$, independent.

**Method 1: Using linearity of expectation**

For uniform distribution on $(a,b)$: $E[Z] = \frac{a+b}{2}$

$$E[X] = \frac{0+2}{2} = 1$$
$$E[Y] = \frac{0+2}{2} = 1$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y] = 1 + 1 = 2$$

**Method 2: Direct calculation using PDFs**

For $X \sim \text{Uniform}(0,2)$: $f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}, & 0 < x < 2 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

For $Y \sim \text{Uniform}(0,2)$: $f_Y(y) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}, & 0 < y < 2 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent: $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{4}$ for $(x,y) \in (0,2) \times (0,2)$

$$E[X + Y] = \int \int (x + y) f_{X,Y}(x,y) \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \int_0^2 \int_0^2 (x + y) \cdot \frac{1}{4} \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} \int_0^2 \int_0^2 (x + y) \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} \int_0^2 \left[\frac{x^2}{2} + xy\right]_0^2 \, dy$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} \int_0^2 (2 + 2y) \, dy$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} \left[2y + y^2\right]_0^2$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} (4 + 4) = 2$$

**Answer:** $E[X + Y] = 2$

**Note:** This result follows directly from the linearity of expectation, regardless of whether the random variables are independent. The independence was not actually needed for this calculation.

## Problem 14: Finding the Constant in PDF (Additional)

Let $X$ be a random variable with PDF:
$$f_X(x) = \begin{cases} ax^5, & \text{if } 0\le x \le 3 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Find the value of the constant $a$.

### Solution {.solution-header}

**Key property:** For any PDF, $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) \, dx = 1$

**Step 1: Set up the integral**
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) \, dx = \int_0^3 ax^5 \, dx = 1$$

**Step 2: Evaluate the integral**
$$\int_0^3 ax^5 \, dx = a \int_0^3 x^5 \, dx = a \left[\frac{x^6}{6}\right]_0^3 = a \cdot \frac{3^6}{6} = a \cdot \frac{729}{6}$$

**Step 3: Solve for $a$**
$$a \cdot \frac{729}{6} = 1$$
$$a = \frac{6}{729} = \frac{6}{729} = \frac{2}{243}$$

**Verification:**
$$\int_0^3 \frac{2}{243} x^5 \, dx = \frac{2}{243} \cdot \frac{729}{6} = \frac{2 \times 729}{243 \times 6} = \frac{1458}{1458} = 1$$ ‚úì

**Answer:** $a = \frac{2}{243}$

**General formula:** For $f(x) = cx^n$ on $[0,b]$, we have $a = \frac{n+1}{b^{n+1}}$.

In our case: $n = 5$, $b = 3$, so $a = \frac{5+1}{3^{5+1}} = \frac{6}{3^6} = \frac{6}{729} = \frac{2}{243}$ ‚úì
