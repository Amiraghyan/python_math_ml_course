# Quarto
Files must be lowercase, I have no idea why. GitHub may not approach names in a case-sensitive way.

# Useful commands
`make render`: quarto render-s and pushes to GitHub
`make push`: just git add, commit and push
`make render/push MSG="message"`: renders and pushes with a custom message (defaults to "render")
