By comparing these vectors using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, you can determine which word is “closer” in meaning.\nGiven Word Embeddings:\n\ncheese: [1, 2]\nmushroom: [3, 1]\ntasty: [2, 2]\n\nTasks:\n\nEuclidean Distance:\n\na. Compute the Euclidean distance between tasty and cheese.\n\nb. Compute the Euclidean distance between tasty and mushroom.\n\nc. Which word is closer to tasty based on the Euclidean distance?\n\nCosine Similarity:\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\na. Compute the cosine similarity between tasty and cheese using the formula above.\nb. Compute the cosine similarity between tasty and mushroom.\n\nc. Based on cosine similarity, which word is closer to tasty?\n\nDiscussion:\n\nCompare the outcomes from the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity calculations.\n\nDiscuss why one metric might be preferred over the other in different NLP applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCool video by 3blue1brown discussing word vectors (embeddings)",
